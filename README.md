A courier goes through several places including distribution center and delivered using transportation services like, aero plane, ship, road transport etc. All Users would like to track their consignment through website or SMS. User can track their order, till where the courier has been reached just by logging in and entering courier number to track the location of the package. Here every distribution channel terminal has a system operated by authorized people at that particular point of distribution. Each distribution has login access. On logging, the distributer needs to make an entry of a package number that should be notify to customer via SMS.

Only admin can view the customers feedback.








DEFINING THE PROBLEM
	In this existing system, this website is not totally automated. Though the system is computerized to a particular extent, it has to do a lot of manual work. The entire database is maintained manually which is rather tedious and error prone. Queries are not answered properly due to lack of communication. More space is required to keep all the records. Without internet, cannot access the courier details. Authority at every point has to manually enter the location of the goods. User does not get the exact location of its order.
Drawback
•	 Delay.
•	Wear and Tear.
•	Fluctuations in Pay.
